This game will use basic movement commands to navigate between rooms, gather items, and conquer a villian in the end.
Steps:

- Create dictionary for Items
- Create dictionary for Rooms
- Dictionaries will have numbers assigned to corresponding items and rooms
- Find a way to use those numbers to correlate the rooms to the items inside them
- Commands to go _East, West, North, and South_
- Functions to ammend the inventory variable with current items and rooms that have been visited already.
